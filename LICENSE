                       GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                          Version 2, June 1991

Copyright (C) 2024  sudoXpg

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free software license for software and
other kinds of works. The licenses for most software are designed to take
away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software—to make sure the software is free for all its users.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
To understand the concept, you should think of “free” as in “free speech,”
not as in “free beer.”

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that prohibit anyone
from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. These
restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute
copies of the software, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or
for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you
received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

Developers that use the GPL protect your rights with each version of the
program, but you also have the freedom to change it and distribute your
modifications.

                            TERMS AND CONDITIONS

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program’s source code
   as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
   appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
   disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this
   License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this
   License along with the Program.

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it,
   thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such
   modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you
   also meet all of these conditions:
   a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating
      that you changed the files and the date of any change.
   b) You must offer your modified version of the Program under the same GPL-2.0
      license, so that others may benefit from the modifications under the same
      terms.
   c) If the modified version is distributed under the GPL, you must provide
      access to the source code or make it available.

3. You are not required to release the source code or any modified versions
   if you are not distributing the program or modifications. However, if you
   distribute the Program or modified versions of it, you are bound by the terms
   of the GPL.

4. If you distribute the Program in a non-source form, you must make sure that
   the recipients can access the source code. You can do this by providing
   them with a copy of the source code, or by making it available for free
   through a public distribution system.

5. The Program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT
   ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or
   FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more
   details.

6. You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with
   the Program. If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
